#labels SVN,HowTo
Hey guys I've got us set up on Google Code.

    * Download tortoise SVN:


http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/

    * Restart


    * Make a folder in your eclipse workspace called, "cpsc304assn3"
    * Right click the folder and go to SVN Checkout
    * Here is the URL: https://cpsc304assn3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
    * the username is your Google username
    * the password is eq6vv3Dz5BE8


Do not regenerate the pass.

    * Once all the files have been grabbed from google code, you will see a green check mark on your cpsc304assn3 folder.



Enjoy


Matt
